//BINARY TREES
//each node only has 2 children -- left and right

//BINARY SEARCH TREES
//each node only has 2 children -- left and right
//ordered
//numbers less than are to the left of parent node
//numbers greater than are to the right of parent node

//the way that we order them makes it very easy and fast to look things up and insert
//searching is quicker, < or > logic at the nodes
